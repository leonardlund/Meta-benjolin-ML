# Meta-Benjolin-ML
This repository contains the datageneration and machine learning code used for training the neural networks used for Leonard Lund's Master's thesis "Timbre-based control of chaotic synthesis: A latent space mapping of the Benjolin" at KTH in Stockholm. The full thesis can be found here:

This code also forms the basis for the journal article "Expanding the machine: notating generative synthesis with a state-based representation and a navigable timbre space" by Madaghiele, V., Lund, L., Holzer, D., Kelkar, T., Tatar, K., Holzapfel, A. The journal has been accepted for publication in Organised Sound, Cambridge University Press.
